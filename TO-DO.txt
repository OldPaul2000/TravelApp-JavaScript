-Implement ajust profile picture scale(based on its natural height)
-When the user presses the search bar the map will be displayed
 and the location view will be updated based on user input
-Fix overflow content scroll in main page(when profile-options-container and app-menu-container are present in the html page
 the user can scroll up the page and take-picture-container element is visible but the user shouldn't be able to scroll
 the page)
-Set views functionality in the proper view class:
 e.g: the methods for changing state of feedView and myPicturesView are written in the footerView
      but they should be written in the feedView and myPicturesView and only the buttons listeners
      should be added in footerView(There are buttons which help access the views mentioned above)
